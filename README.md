An example of what this queue should look like is below

The GUI in your software is to have the same labels, buttons and text as the existing web application, but the "Request Help" buttons will have slightly different functions. When a user presses either the "Request Quick Help" button or "Request Long Help" button, the
application must display a dialog box which asks the user for their name. Once they have entered their name, the application should join the user to the queue, display their name on the screen, and regularly update the amount of time they have been waiting on the queue (roughly once every ten seconds). Further, the "Questions Asked" heading really refers to the questions answered since opening the application, and is tracked separately for quick & long help.
